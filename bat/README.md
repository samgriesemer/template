# Color Setu
For now, can run the `solarized.sh` script to get solarized colors. This will set the `Default` theme to the Solarized setting. I believe the core of this script was developed from an older version of `bat`, so "Default" is not used by default for whatever reason. Set `export BAT_THEME='Default'` in your shell config to get it working properly.
